        <p>Hey, I'm <strong>Chris</strong>—an <em>enthusiastic</em> web developer with a flair for transforming tech dreams into reality. 🚀 My journey started during my record label days when I faced the digital dilemma without a developer budget. In true <em>necessity-breeds-ingenuity</em> fashion, I charted a DIY path into <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and beyond. 💻</p>

        <p>From piecing together my first websites to unlocking the wizardry of <strong>JavaScript</strong>, I realized coding was my unexpected jam. These days, I'm all about <em>frontend finesse</em>, <em>responsive design</em>, and <strong>web accessibility</strong>. Whether I'm crafting slick interfaces, dancing with standards, or engineering scalable backends, it's a blend of <em>technical chops</em> and <em>creative panache</em>. 🎨 Beyond coding, you might find me <strong>cruising London's canals</strong>, <em>composing tunes</em> that hit the right notes, or squeezing in some <strong>PC gaming</strong>. If you're up for geeking out or plotting exciting tech escapades, let's connect! 🤝</p>
