        From setting the rhythm in the <strong className="font-semibold">music industry</strong> to writing lines of code, my journey has been anything but conventional. I began my career orchestrating the melodies of the music world, running my own companies, and carving out a unique path. Yet, amidst the beats and harmonies, I discovered a new passion—<strong className="font-semibold">front-end development</strong>.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-4">
        My technical journey began with the foundational bricks of the web—<em className="italic">HTML and CSS</em>. From there, I delved into PHP, expanding my backend understanding. As I delved deeper, my curiosity led me to JavaScript, opening up a world of dynamic web interactions. Python followed, broadening my horizons further. But it was the allure of modern front-end frameworks like <em className="italic">React, Next, Vue, and Angular</em> that truly solidified my passion. Each step in my journey added a new layer to my expertise, equipping me to tackle diverse challenges with an evolving toolkit.

    <p className="mb-4">
        Today, as an intermediate front-end developer, I bring a harmonious blend of my creative background and technical skills to every project. I craft digital experiences that are not just functional, but also aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. I pride myself on being a <strong className="font-semibold">quick learner</strong>, a team player, and someone who&apos;s always up for a challenge.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-10">
        Outside of coding, I maintain a symphony of hobbies that keep me grounded. Whether I&apos;m penning soulful songs, tickling the ivories on my piano, staying fit, diving into swimming pools, or conquering the latest video games, life is always in tune.
